          First of all, set the parameters for the day of week, hour of that day
          and availability threshold. Then, watch the visualization get updated
          with the results.

        <p>
          Try zooming in and out using the mouse wheel, and moving the map using
          the mouse (click and drag). Whenever your mouse is over a group of
          stations, the availability trends about that group will be displayed
          in the right side of the screen. In this case, the line chart shows
          the availability of the stations with the configured threshold, on the
          day of week that was selected, but the trend line is shown for the
          whole day.

        <h1>How are the probabilities calculated</h1>
        <p>
          The availability probabilities are calculated using the following
          steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Find all the stations that lie within the cursor's radius of
            influence, or any hexagon for that matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each station inside the area, find the bike availability for the
            selected day of week and every hour of day.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the availability for any station within the area is greater than
            the threshold, then the whole area will be considered as available
            in that time slot (hour). If the availability for
            <i>all</i> stations within the area is less than the threshold, then
            the whole area will be considered as unavailable in that time slot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather the aggregated data for all time slots in the selected day
            from the previous step and report only the probability of the hour
            selected in the parameters at the top of the screen. This
            probability of availability gets drawn as a text label inside the
            circle, but is not shown in the hexagons to prevent cluttering. As
            an example, in the following picture, only two stations are
            considered for a Tuesday between 08 PM and 09 PM. The threshold is
            set to 3, and the resulting probabilitiy is 91%. This can be
            interpreted as the chances of finding 3 or more bikes available at
            any of the two stations, on a normal Tuesday, between 08 PM and 09
            PM.
          </li>
          <img src="img/how_to_3.jpg" class="w35 shadow mlra" />
          <li>
            The probability of availability inside the active region (circle) is
            plotted in the line chart, and the trend line for each hour of the
            day is shown at the right side of the screen.
          </li>
          <img src="img/how_to_4.jpg" class="w35 shadow mlra" />
        </ol>
        <p>
          If no stations are found within the area, then the line chart will
          display the probability of availability for the whole city, averaged
          between all the stations for each hour of the day.
